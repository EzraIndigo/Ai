A basic genetic algorithm assessment completed as a university assessment. The Core file written by myself is 'Example.java' and was validated against a fitness function
inside a precompiled class file supplied by the course leader. 

The example.java includes code which works as a basic genetic algorithm for finding the perfect set of numbers in an array to which the fitness is hidden in another class
and only tested againsted and displayed as % of fittest candidate. 

This GA makes use of OO practises in creating array objects, spawning thousands of generations and involving mutations, crossovers and selection techniques. A solution of Zero was considered
'perfect' 
This solution gives a score of 0.0000000000009 running on a fairly decent VM and within a 20 second time limit. Result is close but not perfect resulting in a final mark of 76% which I was happy with.
